Someone of note, such as a news anchor or a well-liked actor is a drunk! Or worse! A drunk/drug addict.\r\n\r\nWe might feel let down, even abandoned by a trustworthy and entertaining celebrity. Then the anger sets in and afterward, the disappointment.\r\n\r\nNow walk back that thought to your own family in which a loved one reveals they have an issue with alcohol. They’ve found themselves addicted to it. They can’t be without it. Life without booze is unattainable.\r\n\r\nIn light of this, it’s best to not act shocked or disappointed, even though these reactions are quite natural, particularly to someone close to you to whom you would never suspect substance abuse. \r\n\r\nNow, having heard the alcoholic news from your loved one, it is figured that the best way to recoup not just your closeness, but your loved one’s health may be through rehabilitation. It, in fact, may be the last resort for your loved one’s health and the relationship you two shared.\r\n\r\n\r\n## REHAB: THE ONLY RECOURSE\r\n\r\nTo the alcohol or drug-addicted person, rehabilitation may seem like more than just a dirty word; rehab could be an ultimate curse. \r\n\r\nRehab comes after rock bottom is reached. Rehab is where the losers who can’t deal with their issues wind up.\r\n\r\nAnd while you may feel similar thoughts of rehab as the last stop for failures, a change of mindset on your part will very much needed.\r\n\r\nDon’t look at rehab as a sucker’s end to an issue a loved one is unable to cope with. Look instead at drug treatment as a courageous first step to obtaining a healthier life.\r\n\r\nThen, once you’ve convinced your loved one that this is the only action to take, be supportive of that person as they fight through their addiction. Stay in touch, take interest in what and how they’re doing in their fight for sobriety. \r\n\r\nIf you’re there for them throughout the length of their battle, the chances are you and your loved one will be closer than ever once they do obtain a lifestyle that is free of addictive behavior.\r\n\r\n## CELEBRITY OR NOT, THIS IS HOW IT SHOULD BE FOR EVERYONE\r\n\r\nWe have to remember that to err is human. No one asks to become an alcohol or drug addict. It isn’t an aspiration that a person ordinarily works their way up to – at least not consciously.\r\n\r\nThe news anchor, the anchor, the socialite and the person of power and influence are, at the end of the day, as human as any of us. Anyone can succumb to the overwhelming power of addictive substances.\r\n\r\nWhile we feel sympathy, maybe even empathy for celebrities who do fall to substance abuse, we should have those same feelings for our family and friends who have also fallen to substance abuse.\r\n\r\nNo one is immune to addiction. And because of that, everyone needs care and understanding once they do admit to a substance abuse problem.\r\n\r\nGive that same care and understanding for those close to you who have addiction issues just in the same way the public gives care and understanding to the famous.\r\n\r\nJust remember, everyone is a celebrity, particularly if they overcome their affliction to go on toward a life where substance abuse is merely a dark, but temporary time in their lives.",
